C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages 
because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language, and most of the programming languages
 follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.

It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc.
 that are being used in many languages like C++, Java, C#, etc.
